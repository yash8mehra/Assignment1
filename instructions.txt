Write a brief but complete report (1-2 page) to present any observations you can make based on the grades you obtain from running your program. 


What to Submit:
For this assignment, please submit a link to a Github Repository that contains the following files:

your *.java source code that implements your solution
your *.class compiled version of your JAVA code above
your report file as a pdf or a word document.


IMPORTANT NOTES:
For your files, please use the specific format for file naming:
CSCI271_Assignment1_StudentFullName_WID.ext

where "ext" is the file extension (like .java, .class, .pdf, etc.)
replace StudentFullName with your FirstName followed by LastName as one word but with the first letter of each in capital letters and the rest in lower case. For example, for me it would be "WilliamKlement"
WID will be your Winthrop id
Please use the above file naming convention for all your files, then add other terms if needed (this would be something like "report" etc.
Please adhere to the programming standards posted on the course webpage on blackboard. Assignments that violate programming standards will NOT BE GRADED!!!!!
